** SOLAR APP **

A little program to put in pratice the knowledge from my Conversion Renewable Energy class in Solar Energy, part of my
Master degree in Sustainable Energy System. 

Sun´s declination: angular position of the sun at solar noon, when the sun is at the local meridian, in relation 
to the plane of the equator.

Cooper equation (1969)
Spencer equation (1971)

In this structure will be include more functions to find Incidence Angle, Solar Zenith and other topic related to solar enegy.

For now is only in command line but I´ll use Flask to user input values in web interface.
